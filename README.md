# alfred-image-utilities

A workflow for making quick changes to image files. Alfred-image-utilities grabs any selected images in the frontmost finder window and can apply changes to them. Most of the time a copy of the image is made and its extension is changed to `<filename>.orig.<ext>`. You can replace the original file by holding <kbd>command</kbd> when executing most commands.
